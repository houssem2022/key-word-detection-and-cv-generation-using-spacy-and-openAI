About the Dioscuri Centre  The Centre’s main objective is to better understand the growth and evolution of pathogenic cells in human diseases from the chemistry and physics viewpoint. While most of the group works on bacterial infections, the Centre is also developing a research programme in cancer biology. In particular, we would like to improve the knowledge of mechanisms that lead to resistance to cancer chemotherapy. The members of the Centre use experimental in vitro models, computer simulations and mathematical theory to create data driven, quantitative models of bacterial infections and cancer. We anticipate that these models can help to develop new treatment modalities. To facilitate translation from the bench to the bedside, the Centre will collaborate with biomedical researchers and with industrial partners. The Centre is co-funded by the Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education and the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research, with additional support coming from NAWA and POLS. The Centre is located in the Institute of Physical Chemistry (IPC, Polish: IChF), Polish Academy of Sciences, Warsaw, Poland.  About IPC IPC is one of the top research institutes in Poland, ranked A+ by the Ministry of Science and Higher Education (top 5% of research units in PL).

The position amounts to 2/3 full-time and is limited to a contract term of three years up to the end of the funding period on March 31, 2025. The successful applicant will work in the work area „From microscopic dynamics to the equation of state of dense nuclear matter“ (subproject WP1 „Bulk properties of QCD matter“), which aims at a quantitative understanding of the equation of state of dense nuclear matter. The Cluster Project ELEMENTS is a collaborative project of Goethe University Frankfurt (leading partner), TU Darmstadt, JLU Gießen, and the GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy-Ion Research. It addresses the physics of binary neutron-star mergers from gravitational waves to the nucleosynthesis of heavy chemical elements and electromagnetic signals. This includes determination of the equation of state of matter at extreme densities, temperatures and isospin. Heavy-ion collisions at moderate collision energies provide access to such forms of matter in laboratory experiments. The challenge is to: (a) identify observables sensitive to the EOS and transport coefficients and (b) to connect properties of matter studied in the laboratory with the characteristics of the matter in NSs. The institute for nuclear physics with around 280 members hosts 15 research groups working in the field of experimental and theoretical nuclear-structure physics, nuclear astrophysics, QCD matter physics and laser and plasma physics. It is one of the largest of its kind world-wide at highest international reputation. The successful applicant will work on the development and application of theoretical methods for the computation of the equation of state of dense strong-interaction matter. The central method will be the functional renormalization group approach. The aim is to improve existing first-principles constraints for the equation of state of strong-interaction at supranuclear densities. The applicant is required to have obtained a scientific university degree equivalent to a Master of Science (MSc) in physics at latest at the moment of the starting of the position. Good knowledge of the functional renormalization group approach as well as good knowledge in the use of numerical techniques from the field of fluid dynamics to solve renormalization group equations are an advantage. Good knowledge of program languages (C++ and/or Python) is an advantage as well. Also good communication skills, ability to work in a team and to share knowledge with colleagues will be considered. Opportunity for further qualification (doctoral dissertation) is given. The fulfillment of the duties likewise enables the scientific qualifications of the candidate. The Technische Universität Darmstadt intends to increase the number of female employees and encourages female candidates to apply. In case of equal qualifications applicants with a degree of disability of at least 50 or equal will be given preference. Wages and salaries are according to the collective agreements on salary scales, which apply to the Technische Universität Darmstadt (TV-TU Darmstadt). To apply, please send a CV, a letter of motivation, as well as a list of publications and certificates to the director of the institute, Prof. Dr. Dr. h.c. mult. Norbert Pietralla (gd@ikp.tu-darmstadt.de) while referencing the identification number.

The main goal of the institute is to design cost-optimal and feasible energy systems which can aid decision-makers in politics and business. Rooftop photovoltaic (PV) installations increase the shares of renewable energy, without requiring open areas in the region. The potential of such installations goes unexploited if a detailed study of the rooftops in the region is not undertaken. Through this master thesis, we intend to improve the estimation of the total rooftop PV potential of any globally given area. This information supports different decision-makers in the design of renewable supply systems. Your Job: At IEK-3, a methodology to estimate the rooftop PV potential by analyzing satellite data is implemented. We aim to improve the method further by generalizing it to countries around the globe further improving the accuracy by, for example: detecting obstacles such as trees that cast a shadow on the PVs, thereby lowering its output detecting and excluding roof areas where superstructures such as chimneys or windows are present detecting and excluding roofs with existing PVs and unavailable roofs such as that of a church Based on this, your workflow can be divided into the following steps: Getting familiar with the existing methodology and codebase Literature review: On existing methods to detect obstacles, superstructures, building type, and existing PVs On image recognition, classification, and clustering using neural networks Implementation of suitable image clustering technique to classify different regions of the world based on the roof-types in the regions Tuning and re-training the existing model for each identified cluster separately. Implementation of a suitable image recognition and/or classification technique to identify obstacles, superstructures, building type, and existing PVs Validation and comparison of the results with those of existing studies Writing the thesis Your Profile: Very good academic marks in computer science, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, mathematics, physics, or a related field of study.

Outdoor sports and recreational activities are gaining popularity with increasing impact on natural systems. Technological advances and enhanced mobility change the footprint that recreational activities leave on the landscape. Relevant information for nature conservation is often difficult to access and incomprehensible for people in outdoor sports due to complex regulations and regional differences. The PhD project is embedded in a cooperative project aiming at the development, implementation and evaluation of a  Digital Ranger  that provides outdoor athletes with easy to access and user-friendly information about nature (protection) and safety and thus promotes sustainable behaviour in ecological systems. One central aspect of the PhD is developing and evaluating alternative solutions for informational add-ons in digital outdoor platforms for improving the interaction of outdoor sports with nature. Qualifications and Specific Competences: The PhD project integrates elements of conservation ecology, computer science, psychology and sport science. We thus seek an excellent, highly motivated candidate with an MSc in Ecology, Psychology, Computer Science, Environmental Science, Sports Science, Biology, Geography or related fields. We expect a strong interest in ecology, outdoor sports and digital transformation. The successful candidate should have solid experience with data analyses, strong collaborative skills, and good skills in English and German. Having worked in programming outdoor applications would be beneficial. Topic and supervisor: We offer a fully funded PhD position in an interdisciplinary team and strong support for your career. The position is embedded in a research collaboration between leading providers of outdoor platforms (Outdooractive; Digitize the Planet), nature conservation (Naturparke Fichtelgebirge and Nagelfluhkette) as well as universities (Bayreuth and Treuchtlingen). The PhD candidate is encouraged to collaborate within the group and further expand activities with relevant stakeholders. The project will support research visits to collaborators and field trips. Place of Employment and Work: The place of employment and work is in the section of Sport Ecology at the University of Bayreuth, Germany. The University of Bayreuth has earned an international reputation for its uniquely interdisciplinary approach to research and teaching and has strong research groups in ecology and sports. The direct surroundings including the Frankenjura and the Fichtelgebirge offer attractive opportunities for outdoor sports in research and in leisure. Part of the PhD position is field work with collaborators including the Naturparke Fichtelgebirge and Nagelfluhkette.  Salary: The salary is based on the public salary scale TV-L E 13 (65%). The PhD position will be funded for three years (subject to a final funding decision). Contact and application: Please apply online via the Applicant portal Uni Bayreuth with meaningful application documents selecting “PhD Sport Ecology” from the drop-down menu. Application deadline October 11th, 2021. The documents will be deleted after the position has been filled in accordance with data protection requirements.

The incidence of immune-mediated and metabolism-related chronic diseases like inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and colorectal cancer (CRC) have dramatically been increasing over the past decades in industrialized countries. In IBD, the intestinal epithelium is challenged by repetitive cycles of wounding and subsequent healing processes due to recurrent inflammatory episodes, and the number and duration of inflammatory insults is associated with an increased risk of developing CRC. The control of healing processes is critical to disease progression and involves luminal (microbiome, diet) factors and immune mediated signals. The metabolism of intestinal epithelial cells is a target of these signals and is a determinant of cellular functions. The identification of disease-associated nutritional and microbial factors and the disease-relevant cellular targets underlying healing responses and inflammation is a major scientific focus of the Chair of Nutrition and Immunology. We are looking for highly motivated and enthusiastic PhD students with an excellent M. Sc. or diploma degree in Nutritional Science, Biology, Biotechnology or a related discipline. Candidates should have a solid background in either immunology, microbiology or molecular biology and should be willing to work with mouse models. We offer a challenging interdisciplinary project at the interface of nutrition, microbiome research and biomedicine, well-equipped laboratories with top-notch facilities (germ-free mouse house, high-throughput technologies for sequencing and mass spectrometry) and a fruitful scientific environment. The positions are available immediately and funded for 3 (+ 1) years. Salary will be determined according to the German collective wage agreement in public service (TV-L 13/65%).

Every developer counts and is expected to make a difference. While your role is nominally in server-side C++ development, we expect that your knowledge and experience are substantially broader, and there will be occasions for you to demonstrate that. The word ‘senior’ in your title is not a gimmick: we expect – and will verify – that you are very knowledgeable and experienced in the art of computer programming in general and in C++ in particular. Our philosophy is simple: fundamental knowledge is never obsolete, while cool things come and go. We endorse and expect creativity and initiative. You will have a chance to use other programming languages, like C#, Lua, or Python, and, who knows, maybe even convince us we should drop C++ and use something else.  Our minimal requirements are: You have at least a Bachelor degree. Yes, in any field, but a field traditionally associated with computer programming, such as computer science, mathematics, physics or electrical engineering, would be a distinct plus. Fundamental knowledge of computer programming. Data structures, algorithms, concurrent programing, elements of operating systems design, that kind of stuff. You are an advanced user of at least one modern operating system and can create application software for it. Your ability to create system software would be a distinct plus. You are ready and willing to learn something new. For example, we did not emphasize any particular OS above, because we expect that with your fundamental knowledge, you can learn whatever OS we think we need to support tomorrow. You have been gainfully employed in a team of software engineers for at least four continuous years (not necessarily within one company), with a significant part of your work in C++. Note “gainfully” in the previous sentence, we generally expect that your experience is more than that, but the minimal requirement is concerned with your ability to market your skills successfully. Note also “in a team”, you need to demonstrate your capacity for successful team work. You are familiar with concepts such as networks, databases, servers, communications and information security, and you have successfully participated in software development involving at least some of that. You are fluent in the C++ language and follow its evolution closely. You are familiar with other programming (scripting) languages. The modern software development cycle and tooling is just something you know, and if you have not worked with a particular platform, IDE, compiler, source control or bug tracking system, you should be able to get going with minimal babysitting. You speak English fluently.  Your assignment will be in the headquarter in Cologne, Germany.

About Moderna : In 10 years since its inception, Moderna has transformed from a science research-stage company advancing programs in the promising-but-still-unproven field of messenger RNA (mRNA), to an enterprise with its first medicine having treated millions of people, a diverse clinical portfolio of vaccines and therapeutics across six modalities, a broad intellectual property portfolio in areas including mRNA and lipid nanoparticle formulation, and an integrated manufacturing plant that allows for both clinical and commercial production at scale and at unprecedented speed. Moderna maintains alliances with a broad range of domestic and overseas government and commercial collaborators, which has allowed for the pursuit of both groundbreaking science and rapid scaling of manufacturing. Most recently, Moderna’s capabilities have come together to allow the authorized use of one of the earliest and most-effective vaccines against the COVID-19 pandemic. Moderna’s mRNA platform builds on continuous advances in basic and applied mRNA science, delivery technology and manufacturing, and has allowed the development of therapeutics and vaccines for infectious diseases, immuno-oncology, rare diseases, cardiovascular diseases and auto-immune diseases. Today, 24 development programs are underway across these therapeutic areas, with 13 programs having entered the clinic. Moderna has been named a top biopharmaceutical employer by Science for the past six years. To learn more, visit www.modernatx.com .

Learning Engineer Crowd.dev Home Office Hey, we're Crowd  We are on the mission to build the tool stack for the age of community-driven companies. Building a vibrant community around products has become more and more important - just think about Stripe or Docker. Nevertheless, there are almost no software solutions in this area and many DevRels, community builders, etc. rely on in-house solutions or spreadsheets to manage their communities.  With Crowd we aim to change this. Our platform enables community teams to track members, analyze activities, and understand developer communities down to the details. Thereby, community builders always know what is the next step for their community.  What we offer  This is a unique opportunity to build a developer-focused product from scratch and take influence on all technical decisions. We are well funded and are now building a remote engineering team to take our MVP to an enterprise grade product. We offer an attractive compensation including employee stock ownership program (ESOP), health insurance, and a stipend for home office supplies.  Your role at Crowd  When joining our team you would have the one-time opportunity to build a developer-focused product from scratch.

Atomistic modelling based on ab initio methods (density functional theory, DFT) has matured into a standard tool for assisting the development of active materials and solid electrolytes in SSB by predicting materials properties such as thermodynamic stability and Li/Na conductivities of bulk phases. Yet, real battery components contain many grain boundaries and interfaces which are crucial for the cell performance and fatigue. The goal of the projects is an in-depth study of the properties and role of such grain boundaries and interfaces using implicit defect-chemistry concepts to predict side reactions [https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.chemmater.7b00890] as well as explicit bicrystal models to study kinetics using direct molecular dynamics simulations and/or nudged elastic-band (NEB) calulations [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpowsour.2020.229041]. The projects are part of larger collaborative research initiatives and will be carried out in close collaboration with world-leading experts in the synthesis of novel high-performance Li solid electrolytes.

Outdoor sports and recreational activities are gaining popularity with increasing impact on natural systems. Technological advances and enhanced mobility change the footprint that recreational activities leave on the landscape. Relevant information for nature conservation is often difficult to access and incomprehensible for people in outdoor sports due to complex regulations and regional differences. The PhD project is embedded in a cooperative project aiming at the development, implementation and evaluation of a  Digital Ranger  that provides outdoor athletes with easy to access and user-friendly information about nature (protection) and safety and thus promotes sustainable behaviour in ecological systems. One central aspect of the PhD is developing and evaluating alternative solutions for informational add-ons in digital outdoor platforms for improving the interaction of outdoor sports with nature. Qualifications and Specific Competences: The PhD project integrates elements of conservation ecology, computer science, psychology and sport science. We thus seek an excellent, highly motivated candidate with an MSc in Ecology, Psychology, Computer Science, Environmental Science, Sports Science, Biology, Geography or related fields. We expect a strong interest in ecology, outdoor sports and digital transformation. The successful candidate should have solid experience with data analyses, strong collaborative skills, and good skills in English and German. Having worked in programming outdoor applications would be beneficial. Topic and supervisor: We offer a fully funded PhD position in an interdisciplinary team and strong support for your career. The position is embedded in a research collaboration between leading providers of outdoor platforms (Outdooractive; Digitize the Planet), nature conservation (Naturparke Fichtelgebirge and Nagelfluhkette) as well as universities (Bayreuth and Treuchtlingen). The PhD candidate is encouraged to collaborate within the group and further expand activities with relevant stakeholders. The project will support research visits to collaborators and field trips. Place of Employment and Work: The place of employment and work is in the section of Sport Ecology at the University of Bayreuth, Germany. The University of Bayreuth has earned an international reputation for its uniquely interdisciplinary approach to research and teaching and has strong research groups in ecology and sports. The direct surroundings including the Frankenjura and the Fichtelgebirge offer attractive opportunities for outdoor sports in research and in leisure. Part of the PhD position is field work with collaborators including the Naturparke Fichtelgebirge and Nagelfluhkette. Salary: The salary is based on the public salary scale TV-L E 13 (65%). The PhD position will be funded for three years (subject to a final funding decision). Contact and application: Please apply online via the Applicant portal Uni Bayreuth with meaningful application documents selecting “PhD Sport Ecology” from the drop-down menu.

Our first product is the world’s lowest APR credit card. Come invent & change the world with us. Who are we? We are a well capitalized (over $60MM in equity funding) team of technology (Microsoft, Facebook), and finance (Square, Discover, CapitalOne, and Goldman) executives with top tier investors -- Founders Fund, Khosla Ventures, Max Levchin, NYCA, Sequoia, etc. Our team includes people who have built Financial products (Square/CashApp, the earliest CapitalOne credit cards) Consumer products (Internet.org, Xbox) Technology infrastructure (Visual Studio, Windows & Azure, helped design the C++ & C# languages) Mathematics & science infrastructure (computational research at NASA’s JPL). We are missionaries that like to work hard on important problems - and build products that become infrastructure for society. We believe that using technology to lower the cost of capital for consumers is one of these problems - and if we can do it, it could have a big impact on a lot of people’s lives. Our philosophy We are a technology company at heart - and we seek to invent & advance the state of the art to build insanely great consumer financial products - starting with the world’s first home-equity backed credit card. We like to deeply understand the nuances & excruciating details of the systems we are building on top of - whether it be legal frameworks & regs, or APIs and 3rd party data-providers. No work is beneath any of us - from the CEO to our compliance lead - we get excited to audit our database to check each cell to ensure that they are correct and to pick up customer support calls. We believe inventing great products happens at the intersection of extremely deep detailed domain knowledge & a very lateral thought process. We don’t like to invent for the sake of it - we do it when we think we can make something significantly better. We value being pragmatic, rational, fast, minimalist, detailed oriented, and obsessively customer-centric. Who are you? We are looking for an experienced engineer who can dig deep into all aspects of a system. You will be digging into performance issues of a web application, debugging race conditions across client/server boundaries, and controlling robots across the continental United States (yes, really). You will also be responsible for the architecture of the system, design reviews and code reviews. This role will evolve into having tech leadership responsibilities. You can expect to work on Anything and everything.

This position should be filled by 15 October 2021. Salary: Pay grade 13 TV-L 65%.  All of the diversity of land plants evolved from algae in a singular event. What were the properties that allowed for the conquest of land by the streptophyte algal progenitor of embryophtyes? The answer will not be simple but multifaceted. One major facet is the genetic chassis underlying the ability to dynamically respond to stressors. This is what the ERC-Starting Grant project “TerreStriAL” is all about.  As a PhD-student on the project “TerreStriAL”, you will partake in a systematic study of streptophyte algal stress response to infer how the earliest land plants overcame the challenge of living on land. You will work on candidate proteins that are homologous to key regulators of the physiology of land plants, isolate these from algae (including through immunoprecipitation), and analyze them, e.g., using proteomics. Later in the project, you will integrate your data in an evolutionary framework by applying bioinformatic tools.  Your profile You hold a Master’s degree in Molecular Biology/Biochemistry or related areas with good to excellent grades you have some experience with sterile culturing of organisms you have some experience with methods to purify, separate, and analyze proteins (e.g. SDS-PAGE, Western Blot etc.) you are interested in Plant Science, Molecular Evolution, and/or related areas bioinformatic skills in the analysis of high-throughput data are advantageous are keen to learn a diverse set of techniques have good communication skills in written and spoken English  The University of Göttingen is an equal opportunities employer and places particular emphasis on fostering career opportunities for women.

At the FHI, researchers from all over the world are engaged in basic research in the fields of physics and chemistry at interfaces and surfaces, catalysis research, and molecular physics. The Department of Physical Chemistry (https://pc.fhi-berlin.mpg.de) focusses on the dynamics of elementary processes in solids and at surfaces, in particular, ultrafast dynamics of electronic and lattice excitations, electron-phonon coupling, interfacial charge transfer, spin dynamics, surface reactions, as well as light-matter interaction at the nanoscale. The newly founded Max Planck-Radboud University Center (https://nijmegen-center-ir-fel-research.mpg.de/home) enhances the joint research capabilities of the Max Planck Society and Radboud University (Nijmegen, NL) based on their unique Free Electron Laser (FEL) instrumentation. Our state of the art FELs allow for intense and nonlinear infrared (IR) spectroscopy with applications ranging from biomedicine to chemistry and materials science to astrophysics. Within the projects of the new Center, the Lattice Dynamics (LD) (https://pc.fhi-berlin.mpg.de/latdyn) and THz Structural Dynamics (TSD) (https://pc.fhi-berlin.mpg.de/tsd) groups in the Department of Physical Chemistry offer a joint PhD Position: Understanding Phonon-Driven Ultrafast Switching of Macroscopically Ordered Solids. This position will offer the unique opportunity of combing the ultrafast time- and phase-resolution of the tabletop high-field THz/mid-IR labs (TSD group) with the complementary spatial- and frequency-resolved capabilities of the FHI-FEL-based labs (LD group). The work of the TSD group mainly targets the question how structural dynamics (lattice vibrations, molecular rotations, etc.) can be harnessed and controlled to steer material properties on ultrafast time scales or to discover novel transient states of matter. Therefore, highly intense, few-cycle terahertz (THz) to mid-IR pulses are combined with a broad range of nonlinear and phase-resolved probing techniques with femtosecond time-resolution. The general research interest of the LD group is centered around optical phonons in polar dielectric crystals, their surfaces, hetero- and nanostructures. Nanophotonic systems, e.g. based on phonon polaritons, are investigated with various linear and nonlinear IR spectroscopy techniques, employing the FHI-FEL as a unique intense and tunable infrared light source. Recently, this arsenal has been extended by spatial resolution from infrared-visible sum-frequency generation super-resolution microscopy. Topics of the research: Within the Center’s project “Shaken, not stirred: How phonons can switch the order in ferroics”, we will investigate how vibrational resonances of solids can be employed to trigger ultrafast, but permanent, switching of ordered material properties, specifically magnetic or electric properties. To achieve and microscopically understand such non-volatile control of the responsible order parameters, the project will explore the role of phonons in dynamic symmetry breaking, their anharmonic coupling and their general impact on the ferroelectric or magnetic order. The corresponding experiments will be developed and conducted at existing setups for time-domain nonlinear THz/mid-IR spectroscopy and FEL-based frequency-domain nonlinear microscopy. The project’s highly anticipated insights may provide novel handles for energy efficient data storage or alternative computing platforms in future. The fully-funded PhD position is initially limited to 3 years, with a possibility for extension. The PhD student will be based at FHI in Berlin. The willingness to spend about 20% of the time at the partner group in the Netherlands is anticipated. Your profile: Applicants should hold an excellent Master’s degree or equivalent in physics, chemistry, material science or related fields. Experimental experience in one or more of these areas is highly beneficial: Nonlinear spectroscopy Pump-probe spectroscopy THz spectroscopy Optical microscopy Coherent Phonons Moreover, candidates are expected to have Collaborative spirit and ability to work in an international research environment Affinity for performing complex experiments with a high drive to solve scientific and practical/instrumental challenges.

One priority is the area of Internet of Things (IoT) and Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), which led to the development and ongoing improvements of Mioty, a new low-power wide-area network (LPWAN) technology. Mioty, an ETSI standardised system, is analysed, among other features, with respect to energy efficiency, and compared to other LPWAN technologies, e.g. NB-IoT (3GPP).  To predict the energy consumption of different LPWAN systems, i.e. Lora, Mioty, NB-IoT and Sigfox, a Python based analysis framework has been developed. The goal is to compare LPWAN systems for specific use cases and to find the best, i.e. longest lasting, solution within the required specifications.

What were the properties that allowed for the conquest of land by the streptophyte algal progenitor of embryophtyes? The answer will not be simple but multifaceted. One major facet is the genetic chassis underlying the ability to dynamically respond to stressors. This is what the ERC-Starting Grant project “TerreStriAL” is all about.  As a PhD-student on the project “TerreStriAL”, you will partake in a systematic study of streptophyte algal stress response to infer how the earliest land plants overcame the challenge of living on land. You will work on candidate proteins that are homologous to key regulators of the physiology of land plants, isolate these from algae (including through immunoprecipitation), and analyze them, e.g., using proteomics. Later in the project, you will integrate your data in an evolutionary framework by applying bioinformatic tools.
